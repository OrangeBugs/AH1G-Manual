This document will be your quick reference guide for how to operate the helicopter. AH\u20111G Cobra \u2014 Overview # The AH\u20111G Cobra is a Vietnam\u2011era light attack helicopter developed from the UH\u20111 Huey airframe to provide dedicated fire support. It features a slim, tandem cockpit (pilot and gunner) and a single turboshaft powerplant, giving it a smaller frontal profile and improved forward visibility compared with utility helicopters. Typical roles include close air support, armed escort, and armed reconnaissance. The type is built around a forward\u2011firing weapons philosophy: a nose\u2011mounted gun turret supplemented by hardpoints for unguided rockets and guided anti\u2011armor weapons on later variants. Key features Two\u2011seat tandem cockpit for pilot and gunner Narrow fuselage and reduced frontal area for target survivability Forward weapons station with turreted cannon and external stores Designed for agility, speed, and precision support in low\u2011altitude environments Operational notes Entered service during the late 1960s and saw extensive combat in Vietnam Optimized for quick reaction fire support but limited by light armor and payload compared with larger attack helicopters Influential design that led to numerous follow\u2011on Cobra variants with upgraded sensors and weapons","title":"AH-1G Manual"},{"location":"#dcs-ah-1g-cobra-manual","text":"Welcome to the DCS AH-1G Cobra Manual.

Outlined in red below. The Weapons System consists of two panels. The top panel controls the XM28 gun turret as well as master arm, and the bottom panel controls the wing stations. A third panel appears behind the stick if the XM35 is equipped on the left inboard station. Turret Control / Master Arm Panel # The Turret Control / Master Arm Panel contains useful switches and indicator lights that will be used Master Arm Switch # The Master Arm Switch serves as the main inhibitor switch for all weapons. The down position is safe, the up position is armed. The armed state will be shown by both the switch position, and a blue indicator to the right of the Switch, that will be illuminated when the System is armed, and electrical power is on. Turret Priority Switch # Warning TODO Add the logic for what happens when set to gunner If the Switch is in the down position, the turret moves to a locked forward position, lined up with the pilots gunsight. If the pilot has command of the turret, the orange light will be illuminated if electrical power is on. XM28 Turret Controls # The top row of the Turret Control Panel consists of 1 switch, and 4 indicator lights Note These switches are only relevant when the XM28 Turret is equipped. The indicator lights represent what weapons are equipped to the XM28 Turret. The green 7.62 lights reflect having the M134 cannon equipped on the relative side. The Blue 40mm lights represent having the M129 Grenade Launcher equipped on the relative side. The center switch toggles either the Left, Right or both depending on position, use this switch in conjunction to the indicator lights. especially in situations where different turret types are equipped. Wing Station Panel # The Wing Station Panel controls wing mounted weapons, including firing logic such as salvos, as well as jettison selection. Also included, but not pictured here is the Jettison switch, which is under the red cover above the XM28 Turret Controls Jettison Side Selection # This switch selects which stations are to be jettisoned. The middle position is off/safe, the Up position is the outboard pylons, and the Down position is the inboard pylons. Note The XM35 minigun on the Left Inboard Station Cannot be jettisoned, but the Inboard Right Station will be jettisoned. Jettison Switch # The Jettison Switch will jettison the selected stations if held for 5 seconds. if the Jettison Side Selection Switch is in the off position, this switch has no effect. Note If the Jettison Keybind is pressed, it is not necessary to lift the cover. Using the mouse to click the switch will require the cover to be lifted. Rocket Salvo Selection # The Rocket Salvo Knob selects how many fire pulses are sent when the pilot presses the rocket fire button. The available options are 1, 2, 4, 7, 19. The salvo interval is 0.167 seconds. Wing Station Arming # The Wing Station Arm Switch selects which stations will be fired, when the associated release impulse is triggered. The middle position is off/safe, the Up position is the outboard pylons, and the Down position is the inboard pylons. If The Master Arm Switch is armed, and the Wing Station Switch is set to either inboard or outboard, the Wing Station Arm light will illuminate to indicate if the system is armed. 20MM Panel # This panel is sits at the bottom of the middle of the dash.
