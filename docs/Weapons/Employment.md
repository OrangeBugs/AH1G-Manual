## Turret Employment

### XM28 Turret Pilot Position
To arm the [XM28 Turret](/Weapons/Overview/#xm28-turret) from the pilots position, the [Master Arm Switch](/Weapons/Switches/#master-arm-switch) should be set to ***ARM***, and the [Turret Priority Switch](/Weapons/Switches/#turret-priority-switch) should be set to ***PILOT***. This can be confirmed by checking the blue and orange inicator lights on the [Turret Control Panel](/Weapons/Switches/#turret-control-master-arm-panel) are illuminated.

Specific sides of the turrets can be selected with the [Turret Side Selector](/Weapons/Switches/#xm28-turret-controls). Either left, right or both. This is adventageous when one each of the M134 and M129 are equipped, as they have different ranges, and ideally should not be fired simultaneously.

The Turrets are fired by squeezing the trigger (**"Trigger (Fire Turrets)"** Keybind)

#### Quick Reference Checklist

| Switch | Position |
| ------ | -------- |
| [Master Arm](/Weapons/Switches/#master-arm-switch) | ARM |
| [Turret Priority Switch](/Weapons/Switches/#turret-priority-switch) | PILOT |

### XM195, XM197 Turrets, Pilot Position

To Arm the [XM195](/Weapons/Overview/#xm195-turret) or the [XM197](/Weapons/Overview/#xm197-turret) Turrets from the pilots position, the [Master Arm Switch](/Weapons/Switches/#master-arm-switch) should be set to ***ARM***, and the [Turret Priority Switch](/Weapons/Switches/#turret-priority-switch) should be set to ***PILOT***. This can be confirmed by checking the blue and orange inicator lights on the [Turret Control Panel](/Weapons/Switches/#turret-control-master-arm-panel) are illuminated.

The Turrets are fired by squeezing the trigger (**"Trigger (Fire Turrets)"** Keybind)

!!! Note
    The [XM28 Control Panel](/Weapons/Switches/#turret-control-master-arm-panel) has no effect on these turrets, the inidicator lights will not be illuminated, and the [Turret Side Selector](/Weapons/Switches/#xm28-turret-controls) will be inoperative.

### Gunsight: Turrets (Pilot)

The AH-1Gs Turrets from the pilot seat are boresighted on the center of the gunsight cross.

!!! Warning
    At time of release, gunsight depression is not simulated. This is on our todo list post release, for now, accurate results can be acheived with some practice in our test missions.

## Rocket Employment

Rockets are operated from the [Rocket Control Panel](/Weapons/Switches/#wing-station-panel). Firing pulses are sent to both selected stations, and two rockets, one per station, fire per pulse.

!!! Note
    All Rocket Systems (XM157, XM158, XM159) are operated the same.

To arm the rockets, the [Master Arm Switch](/Weapons/Switches/#master-arm-switch) should be set to ***ARM*** and the [Wing Station Selector](/Weapons/Switches/#wing-station-arming) should be set to **OUTBOARD** or **INBOARD** as desired.

Rocket Salvos can be configured using the [Salvo Quantity Knob](/Weapons/Switches/#rocket-salvo-selection) to either 1, 2, 4, 7, or 19. Rockets are fired in 0.167 second intervals.

Rockets are fired with the **"Weapon Release (Fire Rockets)"** Keybind.

### Gunsight: Rockets

The AH-1Gs Rockets are boresighted to travel along the angled lines at the top of the pilots gunsight, and converge at the point those lines would meet at short ranges.

!!! Note
    Inboard mounted rockets will travel just inside the convergence lines, however the aim point is the same.
