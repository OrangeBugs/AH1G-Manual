## AH‑1G Cobra — Overview

The AH‑1G Cobra is a Vietnam‑era light attack helicopter developed from the UH‑1 Huey airframe to provide dedicated fire support. It features a slim, tandem cockpit (pilot and gunner) and a single turboshaft powerplant, giving it a smaller frontal profile and improved forward visibility compared with utility helicopters.

Typical roles include close air support, armed escort, and armed reconnaissance. The type is built around a forward‑firing weapons philosophy: a nose‑mounted gun turret supplemented by hardpoints for unguided rockets and guided anti‑armor weapons on later variants.
